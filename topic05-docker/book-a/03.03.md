# Creating an image & running it

## Creating the image
 
A Docker image is essentially a snapshot of a container. When used with the `docker run` command, they are used to create a running instance of a container.
To create a Docker image you need a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is essentially a set of instructions that Docker uses to create the Docker image.
Example:
https://github.com/feedhenry/wit-docker-example

To create an image from this example, first clone it.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/feedhenry/wit-docker-example.git
```

Then build the image:

```bash
$ cd wit-docker-example
$ docker build -t wit/example .

```

The image should now be listed, with the `latest` tag.

```bash
REPOSITORY                                                               TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

## Running

### Running & accessing the container

To run the image, use `docker run`:

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm --name wit wit/example:latest
+ exec app
2017/06/06 11:09:02 starting on port 3000 
```

To call the server that's running, we need to find the container IP Address.
You can find this out by running this command in a new terminal/console window.

```bash
docker inspect wit | grep IPAddress
```

```bash
$ curl <ip address>:3000/hello
hello world
```

Try curl localhost to see what the response is:

```bash
$ curl localhost:3000/hello
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 3000: Connection refused
```

### Accessing the container on localhost

To access the server from localhost, you need to expose the port.

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm --name wit -p 3000:3000 wit/example:latest
+ exec app
2017/06/06 11:09:54 starting on port 3000
```

Now try curling it on localhost again:

```bash
$ curl localhost:3000/hello
hello world
```
